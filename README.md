## React Challenge

Since the originial design is good enough to work with, I'm not good at designing so I don't know how to upgrade it 

**What should be done first to work**

- [x] Upgrade all packages to latest version
- [x] Upgrade babel, eslint, jest, webpack configuration

**What I did:**

- [x] All tasks and bonus in the mission list plus
- [x] Refactoring code base and app structure
- [x] Add some animations to make UX looks better
- [x] Add both product and development config for webpack
- [x] Supporting different screen sizes (responsive)

**To run application**


##### `npm run server` or `yarn server`
Must run first to serve datat for application

##### `npm run client` or `yarn client`
Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

##### `npm run build` or `yarn build`
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
Open http://localhost:5000 to run application in production build

##### `npm run test` or `yarn test`
Runs the test watcher in an interactive mode.
By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.
